# Topology and naming

How Go Elemental repositories, modules, packages, and release tags are named, and the module
layout of each tier. The tiers themselves are defined by the organizational
[repository topology](../../../principles/repository-topology.md).

## Repository names

A repository is named for its language and its tier, so the name states what a reader will find
and where it belongs. The language prefix is the only part a re-expression in another language
changes.

- **Core SDK** — `go-core`.
- **Application SDKs** — `go-<application>-sdk`: `go-web-sdk`. The `-sdk` suffix marks a
  development kit and appears on no other tier.
- **Infrastructure libraries** — `go-<technology>`, named for the technology the library
  presents as a service: `go-database`; `go-auth`, `go-storage`, `go-observability`,
  `go-messaging`, `go-ai` as each arrives. A provider sub-module is a nested directory named for
  the target API or system, never the driver it wraps: `postgres`, not `pgx`.
- **Templates** — the application SDK's name with `-template`: `go-web-sdk-template`.
- **Reference architectures** — named for the application built on the SDK: `go-web-service`.

## Module layout per tier

- A core SDK or application SDK repository is one Go module rooted at the repository, with no
  sub-modules. Packages keep their own short names (`config`, `lifecycle`, `logging`; `web`,
  `middleware`), so the import path names the repository and the identifier in code stays the
  package's: `web.Server`, `database.New`.
- An infrastructure library is one base module rooted at the repository, presenting the standard
  tier, with each provider a nested sub-module that has its own `go.mod`. Keeping the base and
  its providers in one repository makes a change spanning them atomic: it is made and exercised
  together through `go.work` before any tag is cut.
- A template repository roots its module at `template/`, so generation copies exactly the
  subtree and never the repository's management layer.
- A reference architecture is a single module and the repository's only releasable artifact.
- A package is split from its parent by growth or by dependency weight, never by topic alone: a
  sub-package is earned when its contents are a growth area or when a dependency is heavy enough
  that the rest of the module should not compile it.

## Application-layer import direction

Every Go Elemental application — whatever its type — divides into three tiers with one import
direction: `cmd/*` imports only `internal/*`, `internal/*` is the composition root and may import
any root-level package, and nothing at the root level imports `internal/*`. A `cmd/*` binary is
initialization alone: it constructs the application from `internal/*` and never reaches past it.
`internal/*`'s own layers import each other and the root-level packages that make up the
application's domain and infrastructure, but the reverse never happens — a root-level package
importing back into `internal/*` would make domain code depend on how it is wired, not on what it
is.

Go's `internal/` visibility rule enforces only the outer edge: nothing outside the module can
import a package under `internal/`. It enforces nothing on the inner one — within the module, a
root-level package importing `internal/domain` compiles. The direction is a convention, kept by
review and package documentation, not by the compiler.

This is an Application-layer principle, independent of application type: what a web service's
`internal/app` orchestrates from `internal/infrastructure`, `internal/domain`, and
`internal/reactors` (see the [web service template](../go-web-sdk-template/baseline.md)) is one
realization; a CLI or a worker composes its own `internal/*` layers the same way. It does not
apply to a core SDK or an application SDK, which are libraries, not applications, and have no
`internal/*` composition root of their own.

## Release tags

- A module rooted at the repository is tagged `v<semver>`.
- A nested sub-module is tagged with its directory as prefix: `postgres/v0.1.0`,
  `template/v0.1.0`. The prefix is a resolution requirement: the Go module proxy resolves a
  subdirectory module's versions from tags prefixed with exactly that subdirectory.
