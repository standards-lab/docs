# Repository topology

A repository is scoped to one concern of its standard. A reader who opens an infrastructure
library sees the organization's conventions for that technology and nothing else, and a consumer
who depends on it pulls in exactly one service. The organization defines five repository tiers,
and every module repository of a standard belongs to exactly one:

- **Core SDK** — the common primitives useful across all of a standard's application types:
  configuration, process lifecycle, logging. One repository per standard, at the bottom of the
  dependency graph, with no knowledge of its dependents.
- **Application SDKs** — one repository per application type, defining what makes that type of
  program: a web service SDK, a command-line SDK, a worker SDK, each created once a consumer
  warrants it. An application SDK builds on the core SDK and never on an infrastructure library.
- **Infrastructure libraries** — one repository per external technology, presenting that
  technology as a service in two tiers ([service tiers](service-tiers.md)): a base module
  defining the standard tier, with providers as independently versioned sub-modules. An
  infrastructure library builds on the core SDK and never on an application SDK.
- **Templates** — one repository per application SDK. A template scaffolds an initial
  application of its SDK's type: minimal, runnable, and free of any provider, so a generated
  application chooses its own infrastructure.
- **Reference architectures** — the holistic reference for an application SDK: one application
  composing the SDK with the services a production system of its type requires, on one declared
  stack. A variant — another provider, another style, another application type — is a separate
  focused reference architecture, created when a consumer demands it, never a switch inside the
  cohesive one.

The harness repositories (agent tooling) and the organization-context repositories stand outside
the five tiers.

## Dependencies run downward, one tier at a time

A reference architecture depends on its application SDK, the infrastructure libraries it
composes, and the core SDK. A template depends on the core SDK and its one application SDK. An
application SDK and an infrastructure library never depend on each other; both depend on the
core SDK alone. The core SDK depends only on what its standard's dependency line admits.
Knowledge follows the same direction: a repository documents its dependencies and never names
its dependents ([dependencies flow downward only](downward-dependencies.md)).

## Versioning across the tiers

Each repository releases independently ([independent releases](independent-releases.md)), and
the library tiers stabilize together. The core SDK, an application SDK, and the infrastructure
libraries its reference architecture composes reach their first stable major version when that
reference architecture does, because the reference is what proves their contracts in one
production-representative composition. Until then the core SDK is a pre-stable dependency shared
by every repository above it; a change to it releases first and is taken up by the coordinated
releases that follow.
